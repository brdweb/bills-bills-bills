### Run the Application

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file** with the following content:

   version: '3.8'

   services:
     bills-app:
       image: ghcr.io/brdweb/bills-bills-bills:latest

         - ./dbs:/app/dbs
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **If deploying to a fresh directory** - initialize the database:
   ```bash

## 🛠️ Application Management

### Start Application

# Using docker-compose (recommended)
docker-compose up -d

# Or manually
docker start bills-bills-bills
```

### View Logs
```bash
# Using docker-compose
docker-compose logs -f

# Or manually
docker logs -f bills-bills-bills
```

### Stop Application
```bash
# Using docker-compose
docker-compose down

```

### Update to New Version

### Data Persistence
Docker Compose automatically creates persistent data directories:
- **`data/`** - User accounts, permissions, and system settings (auto-created)
- **`dbs/`** - Individual user databases (one per database you create, auto-created)
- **Your data is automatically preserved between deployments!**

## 🚨 Security Features

- **🔒 Forced Password Change**: Default admin credentials require immediate password update
- **🛡️ Data Isolation**: Complete separation between different user databases
- **🔐 Secure Authentication**: Session-based authentication with automatic timeouts
- **📝 Input Validation**: All user inputs are properly sanitized
- **👮 Admin Controls**: Granular permissions and access control

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Admin Panel?
- Ensure you're logged in as an admin user
- Check that the Admin button appears after login

### Login Problems?
- Verify default credentials: `admin` / `password`
- If admin login succeeds, you may need to change the password first

### Data Loss?
- Check that volume mounts are working properly
- Ensure `data/` and `dbs/` directories exist and are writable

### Database Errors?
- Restart the application (`docker-compose restart`)
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- Contact support if persistent issues occur

## 📞 Support

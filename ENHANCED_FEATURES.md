## ‚ú® New Payment Period Options

### 1. **Weekly & Bi-weekly**
- Simple weekly recurring bills
- Bi-weekly (every 2 weeks) scheduling

### 2. **Enhanced Monthly Options**
- **Same Day Monthly**: Traditional monthly billing (e.g., 15th of each month)
- **Specific Dates**: Multiple dates per month (e.g., 1st & 15th)
  - Handles months with different day counts automatically

### 4. **Existing Options Enhanced**
- Quarterly and yearly frequencies improved
- Better handling of edge cases (leap years, month boundaries)

## üîÑ Automated Database Migrations

### Migration System Features
- **Zero-downtime updates**: Existing data is preserved during upgrades
- **Version tracking**: Schema version table tracks all applied migrations
- **Automatic execution**: Migrations run on app startup
- **Rollback safety**: Each migration is atomic and reversible
- **Multi-database support**: All user databases are migrated consistently

### Migration Process
1. App checks current schema version on startup
2. Applies any missing migrations in order
3. Updates version tracking table
4. Logs migration status for debugging

### Admin Monitoring
- New `/api/migration-status` endpoint for admins
- View migration history and current versions
- Debug migration issues across all databases

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (`server/app.py`)
- Enhanced `calculate_next_due_date()` function with comprehensive logic
- New database columns: `frequency_type`, `frequency_config`
- Improved migration system with version tracking
- JSON-based frequency configuration storage

### Frontend Changes (`client/index.html`)
- Dynamic frequency options UI
- Conditional form fields based on frequency type
- Enhanced bill display with frequency information
- Improved user experience for complex scheduling

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- New columns added via migration
ALTER TABLE bills ADD COLUMN frequency_type TEXT DEFAULT 'simple';
ALTER TABLE bills ADD COLUMN frequency_config TEXT DEFAULT '{}';

-- New migration tracking table
CREATE TABLE schema_version (
    version INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    description TEXT
);
```

## üìã Usage Examples

### 1st & 15th Monthly Bills
```json
{
  "frequency": "monthly",
  "frequency_type": "specific_dates",
  "frequency_config": {"dates": [1, 15]}
}
```

### Multiple Times Per Week (Mon, Wed, Fri)
```json
{
  "frequency": "custom", 
  "frequency_type": "multiple_weekly",
  "frequency_config": {"days": [0, 2, 4]}
}
```

## üîß Migration Safety
